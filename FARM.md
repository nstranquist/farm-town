# Farm Requirements

### Overview

We want to create a farm where users can grow crops that earn them money, which they can use to expand the farm, buy/sell new buildings, re-arrange their farm, and have a good time.

### Technical Requirements

**Logic:**
- [ ] When the game starts, a new farm is created that has a given height and width, where all plots of land are initially unoccupied (i.e. grass)
  TODO: **Data Structures:**
  ...
- [ ] The user has a series of actions at their disposal. Their definition changes based on whether or not currency is being used. For now, let's ignore currency.
  TODO: **Function name, params, return, and description**
  - [ ] Build on a plot
  ...
  - [ ] Destroy a plot
  ...
  - [ ] Expand their farm in any legal direction
  ...

  *With Currency*:
  - [ ] Buy a plot
  - [ ] Sell a plot
  - [ ] Expansion

**UI**
- [ ] Other actions you might consider that don't directly involve the game logic include:
  - [ ] Selecting a plot
  - [ ] Selecting different "actions" to take i.e. editing, etc.
